## Tutorial: Hello, Quarto

### Some comments before the tutorial

- The tutorial uses the [Visual Editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) in RStudio. We recommend to frequently switch between *Visual* and *Source* mode (the tutorial will explain how to do that) to see how the raw markdown syntax looks like.

- Remember to put all *.qmd* files you download during the tutorial into the RStudio project directory you have created [earlier](preparations.qmd).

- Skip watching the [video introduction](https://youtu.be/_f3latmOhew) for now (the video is great, but too long for the 2h workshop).

### Possible problems and related comments

- The tutorial mentions the Markdown syntax (e.g. `**bold**`) used in Quarto but never gives you [this link](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) where the Pandoc Markdown syntax is described in-depth. 

- The tutorial discusses the `format: html` option in the YAML header and implies that you could also use `pdf` or `docx`. Unfortunately, `format: pdf` will not render for this particular *.qmd* document because the image of the penguins is added from an URL (you can see this when switching to *Source* mode), which for some reason does not work for pdfs...  
However, rendering with `format: docx` works and the result will look like this:

  {{< downloadthis _hello.docx dname="hello" label="Download .docx file">}}
