## Tutorial: Hello, Quarto

### Some comments before the tutorial

- The tutorial uses the [Visual Editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) in RStudio. You can make up your own mind, whether you want to use it in your own future projects or not. We recommend that you frequently switch between *Visual* and *Source* mode during the tutorial to see how the raw markdown syntax looks like (even if using the *Visual* mode might seem more convenient at first).
