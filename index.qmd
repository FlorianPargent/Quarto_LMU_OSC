Welcome to the [Quarto workshop](https://malikaihle.github.io/OSC-Open-Research-Summer-School-2023/Workshops.html#quarto) of the [LMU OSC Summer School 2023](https://malikaihle.github.io/OSC-Open-Research-Summer-School-2023/).

## Structure and Workflow of the Workshop

This is a **self-paced tutorial** of about **2 hours** aimed at **early-career researchers**.
It covers the absolute basics of the scientific and technical publishing system [Quarto&copy;](https://quarto.org/).

The workshop is structured in 5 consecutive parts you can navigate to on the top of the website:

1. [Welcome](index.qmd) to the Quarto Workshop (**you are here now**)
2. [How to install](2_Installation.qmd) Quarto and RStudio
3. [Exercise One:](3_Exercise_One.qmd) Quarto Basics
4. [Exercise Two:](4_Exercise_Two.qmd) Scientific Writing
5. [Links](5_Links.qmd) to further resources


The [Quarto&copy;](https://quarto.org/) project has exceptionally well written tutorials ([Quarto "Getting Started"](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)) and online documentation ([Quarto "Guide"](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)).
Instead of reinventing the wheel, we will heavily link to these resources.
