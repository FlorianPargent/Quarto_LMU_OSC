## Tutorial: Compuations

### Some comments before the tutorial

- The tutorial uses the [Visual Editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) in RStudio. We recommend that you frequently switch between *Visual* and *Source* mode during the tutorial to see how the raw markdown syntax looks like.

If you have problems during the tutorial came back to this page and see the next section for our list of possible issues.
After completing the second tutorial, come back here to our workshop website and continue with the next tutorial [here](get-started_3.qmd).


### Possible problems during the tutorial

- The tutorial discusses yaml options (e.g. `df-print: paged`) on how to display data.frames but does not actually print any data.frame in the .qmd document. You can add the following chunk to test the different `df-print` options:
  ```{r}
  #| echo: fenced
  library(palmerpenguins)
  penguins
  ```
  
- The **Figures** section wants you to copy the following code for referencing a figure into your .qmd document.

  ```{.md}
  @fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
  ```
  Make sure to copy the code into your RStudio in *Source* mode, instead of *Visual* mode. Otherwise it will not work...
