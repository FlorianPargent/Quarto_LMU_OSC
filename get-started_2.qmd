## Tutorial: Computations

### Some comments before the tutorial

- The tutorial uses the [Visual Editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) in RStudio. We recommend to frequently switch between *Visual* and *Source* mode during the tutorial to see how the raw markdown syntax looks like.

- Remember to put all *.qmd* files you download during the tutorial into the RStudio project directory you have created [earlier](preparations.qmd).

- We recommend to skip the [caching](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/computations/rstudio.html#caching) section of the tutorial for now.

### Start the tutorial

If you have problems during the tutorial come back **here** and see the next section for our list of anticipated issues.
*After* completing the second tutorial, come back **here** and continue with the next tutorial [on this page](get-started_3.qmd).

### Possible problems and related comments

- The tutorial discusses yaml options (e.g. `df-print: paged`) on how to display data.frames but does not actually print any data.frame in the *.qmd* document. You can add the following chunk to test the different `df-print` options:
  ```{r}
  #| echo: fenced
  library(palmerpenguins)
  penguins
  ```
  
- The **Figures** section wants you to copy the following code for referencing a figure into your *.qmd* document.

  ```{.md}
  @fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
  ```
  Make sure to copy the code into your RStudio in *Source* mode, instead of *Visual* mode. Otherwise it will not work...
  
- When you render the final .qmd document, this will produce an html file (*computations.html*) that you might want to share with some colleagues to show them your new analysis. However, be aware that the html file does not contain all necessary content. You can verify this by moving the *computations.html* file to another folder on your computer (e.g. the Desktop) and open it from there with your browser. You will see that it does not contain the figures and is also not nicely formatted. To produce a single standalone .html file that you can share with others, add `embed-resources: true` to the html options in the YAML header. The final .html then should look something like this:

    {{< downloadthis _computations-complete.html dname="computations-complete-standalone" label="Download standalone .html">}}
