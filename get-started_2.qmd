## Tutorial: Computations

### Some comments before the tutorial

- The tutorial uses the [Visual Editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/) in RStudio. We recommend to frequently switch between *Visual* and *Source* mode during the tutorial to see how the raw markdown syntax looks like.

- Remember to put all *.qmd* files you download during the tutorial into the RStudio project directory you have created [earlier](preparations.qmd).

### Start the tutorial

If you have problems during the tutorial come back **here** and see the next section for our list of anticipated issues.
*After* completing the second tutorial, come back **here** and continue with the next tutorial [on this page](get-started_3.qmd).

### Possible problems during the tutorial

- The tutorial discusses yaml options (e.g. `df-print: paged`) on how to display data.frames but does not actually print any data.frame in the .qmd document. You can add the following chunk to test the different `df-print` options:
  ```{r}
  #| echo: fenced
  library(palmerpenguins)
  penguins
  ```
  
- The **Figures** section wants you to copy the following code for referencing a figure into your .qmd document.

  ```{.md}
  @fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
  ```
  Make sure to copy the code into your RStudio in *Source* mode, instead of *Visual* mode. Otherwise it will not work...
