For our case, it ist most practical to save it in the project folder you have created for the Quarto workshop.\nThe tutorial does not mention that the Render on Save option in RStudio is document specific and must again be ticked for the new .qmd file if you want to use it as showcased in the tutorial.\nWhen you render the .qmd file as .docx by use of the Render button in RStudio for the first time, RStudio might (misleadingly) ask where to safe the file, even though the .docx file has already been silently created in the background (because the yaml header specifies that all formats should be created on rendering).\nWhen you have used the Render button in RStudio to render .docx this might break the Viewer in RStudio (because RStudio seems to remember the last output format it has rendered and the Viewer does not work for .docx). One solution to fix this is to manually render once as .html or .pdf via the Render options, which should reactivate the Viewer.\nThe tutorial wants you to add a reference to the equation labeled #eq-slr, but this reference is actually already included in the .qmd file."
