Because the installation can take up some time, we recommend to install the following software beforehand, so you can skip these steps later:\n\nIn this workshop, we will use Quarto together with R but Quarto can also be used with Python, Julia, or Observable JS.\nMake sure that you have a recent version of R and RStudio installed. RStudio automatically comes with a version of Quarto. You find instructions on how to install R and RStudio here.\nInstall tinytex, a small version of TeX that can be used to build pdf documents with Quarto:\n\nIn RStudio, open a Terminal window: Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New Terminal\nRun the following code in the Terminal:\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto install tinytex"
