    "text": "Do not get frustrated when Quarto does not get you all the way to the final result that you want! Tinkering with layout options often takes a lot of time and is not always worth the effort. The most important reason for academics to use Quarto is usually to ensure the reproducibility of your analysis. For everything else, do not feel too bad when using some of the following workarounds:\n\nRender your document to .tex or .docx and do some manual formatting required by academic journals.\nInstead of forcing all your (very) senior collaborators to learn Quarto, just give them the rendered .pdf or .docx and incorporate their comments into the Quarto document yourself.\n\nMake sure that your project still renders without problems as often as possible:\n\nFrequently use the Render button when working on your Quarto documents, to ensure that you have not made a mistake. Debugging Quarto documents is very hard when you cannot say for sure which section in your code introduced an error that prevents rendering. Never leave a Quarto project at the end of your workday that does not render correctly! Trust us, just don’t do it!\nWe highly recommend to always use Quarto together with version control. For an introduction on how to use git within RStudio you can use this tutorial. Using version control is even more important when you want to collaborate with your colleagues.\n\nWhen using Quarto together with version control (as recommended!), it is useful to place each sentence in your .qmd document on a separate line. This makes it much easier to follow changes (e.g. fixing a typo in a manuscript), because git can only highlight the line (and not the word or character) in which changes have been made.\nDo not rely on the visual mode too much: Even if you like the Visual Editor, make sure that you gradually learn how do do everything in the raw source mode. When learning, using the visual mode and then switching to source mode to see the result is very useful."

For our case, it ist most practical to save it in the project folder you have created for the Quarto workshop.\nThe tutorial does not mention that the Render on Save option in RStudio is document specific and must again be ticked for the new .qmd file if you want to use it as showcased in the tutorial.\nWhen you render the .qmd file as .docx by use of the Render button in RStudio for the first time, RStudio might (misleadingly) ask where to safe the file, even though the .docx file has already been silently created in the background (because the yaml header specifies that all formats should be created on rendering).\nWhen you have used the Render button in RStudio to render .docx this might break the Viewer in RStudio (because RStudio seems to remember the last output format it has rendered and the Viewer does not work for .docx). One solution to fix this is to manually render once as .html or .pdf via the Render options, which should reactivate the Viewer.\nThe tutorial wants you to add a reference to the equation labeled #eq-slr, but this reference is actually already included in the .qmd file."
