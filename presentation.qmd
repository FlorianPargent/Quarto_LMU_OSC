## Quarto and R Markdown

- Quarto is relatively new and some things might still be more convenient with R Markdown, but this seems to change rapidly.

- Although [R Markdown is not going away](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html#is-r-markdown-going-away-will-my-r-markdown-documents-continue-to-work), new features will probably only be implemented in Quarto.

- We suggest to use Quarto instead of R Markdown for new projects, unless you know that some functionality you need is currently not yet available.
